# 2016 Presidential Campaign Finance Analysis
This project compares Hillary Clinton's and Donald Trump's campaign finance between April 2015 and November 2016, using the [2016 Presidential Campaign Contributions data](ftp://ftp.fec.gov/FEC/Presidential_Map/2016/P00000001/P00000001-ALL.zip) from the Federal Election Commission (FEC). This project primarily uses Python's Pandas library for data frame manipulation and Plotly library for visualization.
